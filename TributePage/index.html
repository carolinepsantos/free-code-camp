        <ul>
          <li><strong>1906</strong> - Grace Murray Hopper was born in New York on December 9, 1906. She was always a curious child, a trait that marked her for life.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1913</strong> - At seven she decided to find out how an alarm clock worked. She disassembled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing - then Grace was allowed to touch only one alarm clock.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1928</strong> - She graduated as a bachelor in Mathematics and Physics at Vassar College.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1934</strong> - At Yale University, she earned her Ph.D. in Mathematics, becoming one of the first women to do so. Her dissertation "New Irreducibility Criteria" was published in the same year.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
            laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
            returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
            pest-resistent plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1941</strong> - When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, Hopper said: “The world was in a very critical position.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1944</strong> - Although Hopper was 37 and considered too old for military service, she convinced a recruiter to accept her as a reservist in the U.S. Navy WAVES program and graduated first in the class. That's where she started her computing career, she worked at Harvard's Mark I on the team led by Howard H. Aiken. During this period, she co-authored three scientific articles based on this project.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1949</strong> - She joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. While at Eckert-Mauchly, she started developing her compiler. Her program converted English terms to machine code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1952</strong> - In 1952, it had completed the development of its linker program (originally called a compiler), which was developed for the A-0 System. "I had a compiler running and no one could touch it," she said in a phrase that became famous. "I was told that computers could only work with arithmetic."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1959</strong> - It did not participate effectively in the creation of the COBOL language, but in a subcommittee that originated in May 1959, which developed the specifications for the COBOL language. Hopper's conception that there was a need to create a common business oriented language gave rise to the acronym COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1967</strong> - The Navy invited Grace to return to active duty to help standardize communication between different computer languages. At that time she was 60 years old and the appointment was scheduled for six months. It lasted 19 years.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1986</strong> - Grace retired from the Navy in 1986 at the age of 79 and was the oldest of all officers on duty. After her retirement, Grace served as a goodwill ambassador and speaker for Digital Equipment Corporation.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1991</strong> - She received a National Medal of Technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1992</strong> - She passed away on January 1, 1992 at the age of 85 in Arlington County, United States.

            "“Grace Hopper was not only an incredible mathematician and computer scientist during a time when it was particularly challenging for a woman to perform these roles, she was also passionate about mentoring young people. Her legacy as a technology pioneer and woman of vision will continue to pave the way for expanding the inclusion of women in all sectors of technology for the next generations. ”
